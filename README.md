# Seimeido-Public

Public knowledge vault and blog source of **誠明堂（Seimeido）**,  
managed entirely with **Obsidian**.

This repository serves as the foundation for *Constella* —  
the forthcoming constellation-style knowledge blog that connects ideas like stars.

---

## 🌌 Overview

**Seimeido-Public** is the open-access version of Seimeido’s internal knowledge base.  
It functions as both:

- A **blog backend**, where each note in Obsidian corresponds to a future web article.  
- A **public research vault**, archiving essays, translations, and technical notes.  

The Vault is maintained in Markdown with YAML front-matter,  
and built into a static site through a Python-based pipeline.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> **誠則明 — Authenticity begets Clarity.**  
>  
> Seimeido believes that open knowledge should form constellations —  
> each note a star, each connection a story.

Constella, the next stage of this vault, will visualize these relationships  
as an interactive graph of knowledge across languages and disciplines.
